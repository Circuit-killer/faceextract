Script written to be able to use face detection data from Picasa in Lightroom.

Parses Piacsa files, and writes info into xmp-files.

Before using the script, you need to change some variables to point to the right 
contacts file and such. You also need the XML library for Perl, and the Perl Exiftool-library installed.

The script has only been tested in Windows 7, with Cygwin.

The procedure goes as follow:

In Picasa, do the face tagging. Check the picasa website for help on that.
In Lightroom, make sure you select all the pictures you want to update, and write all the metadata to files. Thats from the metadata menu.
Go to the folder you have some pictures with people in it and run the Perl script.
Open Lightroom again, select the pictures, and choose to read metadata from files.

It seems to be working okay now, but I take no responsibility for damages it may do to your pictures if you try it. Make sure you have a backup first!

To run the script recursively I use the command:
	find . -name \.picasa\.ini -execdir ~/scriptlocation/faceextract.pl \;
